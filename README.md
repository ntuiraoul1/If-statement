# If-statement
The if statement in Python is a fundamental building block for making decisions in your code. Here's a quick summary:

Conditional Execution: It allows you to conditionally execute code based on whether a certain condition is true or false.
Condition: The if statement evaluates a condition, which is typically a Boolean expression (something that evaluates to True or False).
Code Block: If the condition is True, the indented block of code following the if statement is executed.
else Clause (Optional): You can optionally add an else clause that contains code to execute if the condition is False.
Nesting: if statements can be nested within each other for more complex decision-making logic.
