# If-statement
The if statement in Python is a fundamental building block for making decisions. Conditional Execution: It allows you to conditionally execute code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. Condition: The if statement evaluates a condition, which is typically a Boolean expression (something that evaluates to True or False).
